# Retail-Price-Recommendation-using-Machine-Learning
Machine Learning for Retail Price Recommendation with Python

Mercari, Japan’s biggest community-powered shopping app, knows one problem deeply. They’d like to offer pricing suggestions to sellers, but this is tough because their sellers are enabled to put just about anything, or any bundle of things, on Mercari’s marketplace.

In this machine learning project, we will build a model that automatically suggests the right product prices. We are provided of the following information:
•train_id — the id of the listing
•name — the title of the listing
•item_condition_id — the condition of the items provided by the sellers
•category_name — category of the listing
•brand_name — the name of the brand
•price — the price that the item was sold for. This is target variable that we will predict
•shipping — 1 if shipping fee is paid by seller and 0 by buyer
•item_description — the full description of the item
